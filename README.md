# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
### K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview
This project implements a **K-Means clustering** algorithm for unsupervised learning. It groups similar data points into clusters based on feature similarity.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- K-Means clustering implementation using `scikit-learn`
- Cluster evaluation with **inertia** and **silhouette score**
- Interactive visualization of clustered data

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn notebook
```
